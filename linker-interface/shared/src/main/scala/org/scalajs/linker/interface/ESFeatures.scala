/** ECMAScript features to use when linking to JavaScript.
 *
 *  The options in `ESFeatures` specify what features of modern versions of
 *  JavaScript are used by the Scala.js linker.
 *
 *  - Options whose name is of the form `useX` *force* the linker to use the
 *    corresponding features, guaranteeing that the specific semantics that
 *    they provide will be used.
 *  - Options whose name is of the form `allowX` *allow* the linker to use the
 *    corresponding features if it supports them. Support for such options can
 *    be dropped in any subsequent version of the linker, including patch
 *    versions.
 *  - Options whose name is of the form `avoidX` *hint* at the linker to avoid
 *    the corresponding features *when it does not affect observable
 *    semantics*. They are related to optimizations (for performance or code
 *    size). The linker is free to ignore those options.
 *  - The `esVersion` setting does not follow any of the schemes above. It is
 *    both a hint not to include support for old versions of ECMAScript, and a
 *    command to enable library or language features that rely on recent
 *    versions of ECMAScript.
 *
 *  As of Scala.js 1.6.0, the setting `useECMAScriptSemantics2015` is derived
 *  from `esVersion`. In the future, it might become independently
 *  configurable.

   *  `let`s and `const`s are more difficult for engines to optimize than
   *  `var`s. There have been known cases of dramatic performance issues with
