     *     RTLong(lo << n1, if (n1 == 0) hi else (lo >>> 32-n1) | (hi << n1))
     *   else
     *     RTLong(0, lo << n1)
     *
     * Replacing n1 by its definition, we have:
     *   if (n & 63 < 32)
     *     RTLong(lo << (n & 63),
     *         if ((n & 63) == 0) hi else (lo >>> 32-(n & 63)) | (hi << (n & 63)))
     *   else
     *     RTLong(0, lo << (n & 63))
     *
     * Since the values on the rhs of shifts are always in arithmetic mod 32,
     * we can get:
     *   if (n & 63 < 32)
     *     RTLong(lo << n, if ((n & 63) == 0) hi else (lo >>> -n) | (hi << n))
     *   else
     *     RTLong(0, lo << n)
     *
     * The condition `n & 63 < 32` is equivalent to
     *   (n & 63) & 32 == 0
     *   n & (63 & 32) == 0
     *   n & 32 == 0
     *
     * In the then part, we have `n & 32 == 0` hence `n & 63 == n & 31`:
     *   RTLong(lo << n, if ((n & 31) == 0) hi else (lo >>> -n) | (hi << n))
     *
     * Consider the following portion:
     *   if ((n & 31) == 0) hi else (lo >>> -n) | (hi << n)
     * When (n & 31) == 0, `hi == (hi << n)` and therefore we have
     *   (if ((n & 31) == 0) 0 else (lo >>> -n)) | (hi << n)
     *
     * The left part of the |
     *   if ((n & 31) == 0) 0 else (lo >>> -n)
     * has the following branchless version:
     *   lo >>> 1 >>> (31-n)
     * Indeed, when `n & 31 == 0, we have
     *   lo >>> 1 >>> 31 == 0
     * and when `n & 31 != 0`, we know that ((31-n) & 31) < 31, and hence we have
     *   lo >>> 1 >>> (31-n) == lo >>> (1+31-n) == lo >>> (32-n) == lo >>> -n
     *
     * Was it good? We have traded
     *   if ((n & 31) == 0) hi else (lo >>> -n) | (hi << n)
     * for
     *   (lo >>> 1 >>> (31-n)) | (hi << n)
     * When (n & 31) != 0, which is the common case, we have traded a test
     * `if ((n & 31) == 0)` for one additional constant shift `>>> 1`. That's
     * probably worth it performance-wise. The code is also shorter.
     *
     * Summarizing, so far we have
     *   if (n & 32 == 0)
     *     RTLong(lo << n, (lo >>> 1 >>> (31-n)) | (hi << n))
     *   else
     *     RTLong(0, lo << n)
     *
     * If we distribute the condition in the lo and hi arguments of the
     * constructors, we get a version with only one pack output, which avoids
     * reification as records by the optimizer, yielding shorter code.
     * It is potentially slightly less efficient, except when `n` is constant,
     * which is often the case anyway.
     *
     * Finally we have:

    /* The following algorithm is based on the decomposition in 32-bit and then
     * 16-bit subproducts of the unsigned interpretation of operands.
     *
     * Since everything is interpreted as unsigned, all values are Natural
     * numbers and are >= 0, by construction.
     *
     * We are looking to compute
     * a *[64] b = (a * b) % 2^64
     *
     * We use the notation * and + for mathematical, non-overflowing
     * operations, and *[64] and +[64] for overflowing operations. Eventually,
     * we need to implement everything in terms of *[32] and +[32]. The symbol
     * ^ is used for exponentiation (not bitwise xor).
     *
     * The decomposition in 32-bit components yields:
     *
     * a *[64] b
     *   = ( (2^32*ahi + alo) * (2^32*bhi + blo) ) % 2^64
     *   = ( 2^64*ahi*bhi + 2^32*(ahi*blo + bhi*alo) + alo*blo ) % 2^64
     *
     * With Natural numbers, congruence theory tells us that we can "distribute"
     * `% n` on + and *, as long as we also keep the outer `% n`. To be more
     * precise:
     *   (a + b) % n = (a%n + b) % n = (a + b%n) % n = (a%n + b%n) % n
     *   (a * b) % n = (a%n * b) % n = (a * b%n) % n = (a%n * b%n) % n
     *
     * From the latter, we derive a corollary that we'll implicitly use several
     * times later:
     *   (n * x) % n = 0  for any n > 0 and any x
     *
     * We can use these equivalences to get rid of parts of our computation:
     *
     * ( 2^64*ahi*bhi + 2^32*(ahi*blo + bhi*alo) + alo*blo ) % 2^64
     *   = ( (2^64*ahi*bhi % 2^64) + 2^32*(ahi*blo + bhi*alo) + alo*blo ) % 2^64
     *        -------------------
     *             = 0
     *   = ( 2^32*(ahi*blo + bhi*alo) + alo*blo ) % 2^64
     *
     * Observe that we can rewrite any quantity x as
     * x = n*(x/n) + x%n
     * where n is > 0 and / denotes the floor division.
     *
     * We can rewrite the product ahi*blo as
     *
     * ahi*blo
     *   = 2^32*(ahi*blo / 2^32) + (ahi*blo % 2^32)
     *   = 2^32*(ahi*blo / 2^32) + (ahi *[32] blo)
     *
     * Similarly,
     *
     * bhi*alo = 2^32*(alo*bhi / 2^32) + (alo *[32] bhi)
     *
     * Taking back our complete computation:
     *
     * a *[64] b
     *   = ( 2^32*(ahi*blo + bhi*alo) + alo*blo ) % 2^64
     *   = ( 2^64*(ahi*blo / 2^32) + 2^32*(ahi *[32] blo)
     *        + 2^64*(alo*bhi / 2^32) + 2^32*(alo *[32] bhi)
     *        + alo*blo ) % 2^64
     *
     * where distributing % 2^64 allows to get rid of the most awful parts:
     *
     *   = ( 2^32*(ahi *[32] blo) + 2^32*(alo *[32] bhi) + alo*blo) % 2^64
     *
     * Now we focus on the `alo*blo` part. We decompose it in 16-bit components.
     *
     * alo * blo
     *   = 2^32*a1*b1 + 2^16*a1*b0 + 2^16*a0*b1 + a0*b0
     *
     * Because a1, a0, b1 and b0 are all <= 2^16-1, their pair-wise products
     * are all <= (2^16-1)^2 = 2^32 - 2*2^16 + 1 = 0xfffe0001 < 2^32. This
     * means that, for example,
     *   a1*b0 = (a1*b0) % 2^32 = a1 *[32] b0
     * with the same applying to other subproducts.
     *
     * Let
     *   a1b1 = a1 *[32] b1
     *   a1b0 = a1 *[32] b0
     *   a0b1 = a0 *[32] b1
     *   a0b0 = a0 *[32] b0
     *
     * Each of those is <= 0xfffe0001.
     *
     * We now have:
     *
     * alo * blo
     *   = 2^32*a1b1 + 2^16*a1b0 + 2^16*a0b1 + a0b0
     *
     * We can decompose it using / and % as follows:
     * alo * blo
     *   = 2^32*((alo * blo) / 2^32) + ((alo * blo) % 2^32)
     *
     * Let
     *   aloblo = (alo * blo) % 2^32
     *   carry_from_lo_* = (alo * blo) / 2^32
     *
     * Then
     * alo * blo = 2^32 * carry_from_lo_* + aloblo
     *
     * aloblo = (alo * blo) % 2^32
     *   = (2^32*a1b1 + 2^16*a1b0 + 2^16*a0b1 + a0b0) % 2^32
     *   = (2^16*a1b0 + 2^16*a0b1 + a0b0) % 2^32
     *   = (((2^16*a1b0 % 2^32 + 2^16*a0b1 % 2^32) % 2^32) + a0b0 % 2^32) % 2^32
     *   = (2^16*a1b0 % 2^32) +[32] (2^16*a0b1 % 2^32) +[32] (a0b0 % 2^32)
     *   = (a1b0 <<[32] 16) +[32] (a0b1 <<[32] 16) +[32] a0b0
     *
     * carry_from_lo_* is more difficult.
     *
     * carry_from_lo_* = (alo * blo) / 2^32

     *
     * Substituting,
     *
     * a *[64] b
     *   = ( 2^32*(ahi *[32] blo) + 2^32*(alo *[32] bhi) + 2^32*carry_from_lo_* + aloblo ) % 2^64

     * Lemma: (n * x) % (n * m) = n * (x % m)

     * The remainder must then be < 10^9, and is therefore an int32.
     *
     * The quotient must be <= ULong.MaxValue / 10^9, which is < 2^53, and
     * is therefore a valid double. It must also be non-zero, since
     * (lo, hi) >= 2^53 > 10^9.
     *
     * We should do that single division as a Long division. However, that is
     * slow. We can cheat with a Double division instead.
     *
     * We convert the unsigned value num = (lo, hi) to a Double value
     * approxNum. This is an approximation. It can lose as many as
     * 64 - 53 = 11 low-order bits. If we were *truncating* the bits without
     * rounding, |approxNum - num| could be as large as 2^11 - 1.
     * Round-to-nearest limits the actual difference to half that range, with
     * the maximum difference 2^10 being reached for values whose highest-order
     * bit is 1 and whose lowest-order 11 bits are exactly 100 0000 0000.
     * Hence |approxNum - num| <= 2^(11-1) = 2^10.
     *
     * We then compute an approximated quotient
     *   approxQuot = floor(approxNum / 10^9)
     * instead of the theoretical value
     *   quot = floor(num / 10^9)
     *
     * Since 10^9 > 2^29 > 2^10, we have |approxNum - num| < 10^9.
     * Therefore, |approxQuot - quot| <= 1.
     *
     * We also have 0 <= approxQuot < 2^53, which means that approxQuot is an
     * "unsigned safe double" and that `approxQuot.toLong` is lossless.
     *
     * At this point, we compute the approximated remainder
     *   approxRem = num - 10^9 * approxQuot.toLong
     * as if with Long arithmetics.
     *
     * Since the theoretical remainder rem = num - 10^9 * quot is such that
     * 0 <= rem < 10^9, and since |approxQuot - quot| <= 1, we have that
     *   -10^9 <= approxRem < 2 * 10^9
     *
     * Interestingly, that range entirely fits within a signed int32.
     * That means approxRem = approxRem.toInt, and therefore
     *
     *   approxRem
     *     = (num - 10^9 * approxQuot.toLong).toInt
     *     = num.toInt - 10^9 * approxQuot.toLong.toInt (thanks to modular arithmetics)
     *     = lo - 10^9 * unsignedSafeDoubleLo(approxQuot)
     *
     * That allows to compute approxRem with Int arithmetics without loss of
     * precision.
     *
     * We can use approxRem to detect and correct the error on approxQuot.
     * If approxRem < 0, correct approxQuot by -1 and approxRem by +10^9.
     * If approxRem >= 10^9, correct them by +1 and -10^9, respectively.
     *
     * After the correction, we know that approxQuot and approxRem are equal
     * to their theoretical counterparts quot and rem. We have successfully
     * computed the correct quotient and remainder without using any Long
     * division.
     *
     * We can finally convert both to strings using the native string
     * conversions, and concatenate the results to produce our final result.

     * `x.toDouble` is lossless, then the result of `x.toFloat` is equivalent
     * to `x.toDouble.toFloat`.
     *
     * However, as illustrated in #4466, it is not equivalent when the Long
     * value is very close though not equal to a Float midpoint. Indeed, in
     * that case the conversion to Double can be rounded to the Float midpoint,
     * destroying the information of whether the Long value was above or below
     * the midpoint. When converting the Double into Float, this causes
     * rounding to "even" where a round up or down would have been necessary.
     *
     * To avoid that, we first "compress" the input Long `x` into another Long
     * `y` such that:
     * - `y.toDouble` is lossless, and
     * - `y.toFloat == x.toFloat`.
     *
     * The algorithm works as follows:
     *
     * If the input is a signed safe Double, then the conversion to double is
     * lossless, so we don't have to do anything special (`y == x` in terms of
     * the above explanation).
     *
     * Otherwise, let us first assume that `x >= 0`. In that case, we know that
     * the input's highest 1 bit is in the 11 highest-order bits. That means
     * that rounding to float, which only has 24 bits in the significand, can
     * only take into account the `11 + 23 + 1 = 35` highest-order bits (the
     * `+ 1` is for the rounding bit). The remaining bits can only affect the
     * result by two states: either they are all 0's, or there is at least one
     * 1. We use that property to "compress" the 16 low-order bits into a
     * single 0 or 1 bit representing those two states. The compressed Long
     * value `y = (compressedLo, hi)` has at most `32 + 17 = 49` significant
     * bits. Therefore its conversion to Double is lossless.
     *
     * Now that we always have a lossless compression to Double, we can perform
     * it, followed by a conversion from Double to Float, which will apply the
     * appropriate rounding.
     *
     * (A similar strategy is used in `parseFloat` for the hexadecimal format,
     * where we only have the non-negative case.)
     *
     * For the case `x < 0`, logically we should negate it, perform the above
     * transformation and convert to Double, then negate the result. It turns
     * out we do not need a separate code path. Indeed, if x is a safe double,
     * then -x also converts losslessly (-x may not be safe double by our
     * definition, because it could be exactly 2^53, but the conversion is
     * still exact). Otherwise, we should apply a compression if
     * `(-x & 0xffffL) != 0L`. Because of how two's complement negation work,
     * that is equivalent to `(x & 0xffffL) != 0L`, and therefore also
     * equivalent to `(lo & 0xffff) != 0`. When we do need a compression, we
     * can do it on the signed representation just as well as the unsigned
     * representation, because it only affects `lo`, and `lo` is interpreted as
     * unsigned regardless, when converting to a double.

  /* The algorithm of the following method uses 3 different cases, depending on

   *
   * - 0 < b < 2²¹
   * - 2²¹ <= b < 2⁶²
   * - 2⁶² <= b < 2⁶⁴
   *
   * The last case should be rare, as it is virtually useless in practice.
   * It delegates to a separate method `unsignedDivModHugeDivisor`.
   * The proof for the first two cases follows.
   *
   * The overall shape of the algorithm is inspired by Hacker's Delight,
   * Section 9-5, Figure 9-5 (doubleword division based on "long" division,
   * i.e., 64-by-32 division with a 32-bit result). We do not have that "long"
   * division, but we do have a `double` division, which we will use with
   * similar intent, although the applicability and properties are very
   * different.
   *
   * Preliminaries
   * =============
   *
   * Below, we use the mathematical definition of operators, on reals.
   * The functions div(a, b) and rem(a, b) denote the floor division and
   * its remainder. Formally, they are defined as div(a, b) = ⌊a / b⌋ and
   * rem(a, b) = a - b∙div(a, b). They are not limited to any bit width, nor to
   * integers. When the operands are known to be non-negative integers and fit
   * in a particular bit width, they correspond to the computer semantics of
   * unsigned integer division and remainder.
   *
   * For all reals a and b with b > 0, we have 0 <= rem(a, b) < b.
   *
   * The method we are implementing here computes div(a, b) if askQuotient
   * is true, and rem(a, b) otherwise.
   *
   * The function ◦(x) rounds the real value x to the nearest `double`
   * value, breaking ties to even. Double division can be expressed in
   * terms of ◦ as ◦(a / b).
   *
   * Rounding never goes "farther than necessary" in any direction. Formally,
   * for all reals x, y such that x >= y and y is exactly representable as a
   * `double` value, we have ◦(x) >= y. Similarly for x <= y. We refer to this
   * as the no-round-across-boundary property.
   *
   * For all integers 0 <= a, b < 2⁵³, ⌊◦(a / b)⌋ = ⌊a / b⌋ = div(a, b). This
   * property is a corollary of Theorem 1 in
   *
   *   Vincent Lefèvre. The Euclidean Division Implemented with a
   *   Floating-Point Division and a Floor.
   *   [Research Report] RR-5604, INRIA. 2005, pp.16. <inria-00070403>
   *   https://hal.science/inria-00070403/
   *
   * The function wrap32(x) denotes the JavaScript operation (x | 0), with
   * the result interpreted as unsigned. For x a non-negative `double` value,
   * by spec, it computes wrap32(x) = rem(⌊x⌋, 2³²). It is not defined for
   * non-`double` values. Clearly, if 0 <= x < 2³², then wrap32(x) = ⌊x⌋.
   *
   * Combining the above two properties, we have that for all integers
   * 0 <= a, b < 2⁵³, if div(a, b) < 2³², then div(a, b) can be computed with a
   * double division and the wrap operation. Since ⌊◦(a / b)⌋ = div(a, b) and
   * div(a, b) < 2³², we have ◦(a / b) < 2³². Therefore, we have
   *
   *   wrap32(◦(a / b)) = ⌊◦(a / b)⌋ = ⌊a / b⌋ = div(a, b)
   *
   * The quantities alo, ahi, blo and bhi are interpreted as unsigned,
   * and are therefore mathematical values in the range [0, 2³²).
   * By definition, a = 2³²∙ahi + alo and b = 2³²∙bhi + blo.
   *
   * Case 0 < b < 2²¹
   * ================
   *
   * In this case, b = blo and bhi = 0.
   *
   * We apply the "grade-school algorithm" in base 2³².
   * We decompose a as
   *
   *   a = 2³²∙ahi + alo
   *     = 2³²∙(b∙div(ahi, b) + rem(ahi, b)) + alo
   *     = 2³²∙b∙div(ahi, b) + 2³²∙rem(ahi, b) + alo
   *
   * We first prove for the case askQuotient = true.
   *
   *   div(a, b)
   *     = ⌊ a / b ⌋
   *     = ⌊ (2³²∙b∙div(ahi, b) + 2³²∙rem(ahi, b) + alo) / b ⌋
   *     = ⌊ (2³²∙b∙div(ahi, b)) / b + (2³²∙rem(ahi, b) + alo) / b ⌋
   *     = ⌊ (2³²∙div(ahi, b)) + (2³²∙rem(ahi, b) + alo) / b ⌋
   *       since the first term is whole, we can take it out of the floor function:
   *     = 2³²∙div(ahi, b) + ⌊(2³²∙rem(ahi, b) + alo) / b⌋
   *     = 2³²∙div(ahi, b) + div(2³²∙rem(ahi, b) + alo, b)
   *     = 2³²∙div(ahi, b) + div(2³²∙k + alo, b)
   *
   * for k = rem(ahi, b).
   *
   * Since k = rem(ahi, b) < b and alo < 2³², we know that 2³²∙k + alo < 2³²∙b.
   * That means div(2³²∙k + alo, b) < 2³². We can decompose the result in hi
   * and lo words as
   *
   *   quotHi = div(ahi, b)
   *   quotLo = div(2³²∙k + alo, b)
   *
   * Since ahi < 2³² and b < 2²¹ < 2³², quotHi can be computed with a 32-bit
   * unsigned division. We can compute k from the definition of rem as
   *
   *   k = rem(ahi, b)
   *     = ahi - b∙div(ahi, b)
   *     = ahi - b∙quotHi
   *
   * Because the three operands and the result fit in 32-bit unsigned integers,
   * the computation can be performed modulo 2³², using `int` operations.
   *
   * We still need to compute quotLo. By construction, k < b < 2²¹. Therefore,
   * 2³²∙k + alo < 2³²∙(k + 1) <= 2³²∙b < 2⁵³. Since both operands of the div
   * of quotLo are < 2⁵³, and since quotLo < 2³², we can compute it with a
   * double division and the wrap operation as
   *
   *   quotLo = wrap32(◦((2³²∙k + alo) / b))
   *
   * For the case askQuotient = false, we take the previous result for
   * div(a, b) and expand it into the definition of rem(a, b):
   *
   *   rem(a, b)
   *     = a - b∙div(a, b)
   *     = a - b∙(2³²∙div(ahi, b) + div(2³²∙k + alo, b))
   *     = (2³²∙ahi + alo) - b∙2³²∙div(ahi, b) - b∙div(2³²∙k + alo, b)
   *     = 2³²∙(ahi - b∙div(ahi, b)) + alo - b∙div(2³²∙k + alo, b)
   *     = 2³²∙rem(ahi, b) + alo - b∙div(2³²∙k + alo, b)
   *     = 2³²∙k + alo - b∙div(2³²∙k + alo, b)
   *     = 2³²∙k + alo - b∙quotLo
   *
   * The result rem(a, b) < b < 2²¹. Moreover, k, alo, b = blo and quotLo all
   * fit in unsigned 32-bit integers. That means the last expression can be
   * computed modulo 2³², using `int` operations. The term 2³²∙k disappears,
   * leaving
   *
   *   rem(a, b) = alo -[int] (blo *[int] quotLo)
   *
   * In that code path, it is more efficient to compute k from its definition
   * k = rem(ahi, b), as an unsigned integer remainder operation, since we do
   * not need quotHi for anything else.
   *
   * Case 2²¹ < b < 2⁶²
   * ==================
   *
   * In this case, we compute an approximation of the quotient using double
   * division, where we approximate the dividend and divisor as doubles. We
   * then compute the approximated remainder associated to that approximated
   * quotient (using `long` operations for the definition of remainder), and
   * use it to correct the result.
   *
   * The computations that we perform are:
   *
   *   â = ◦(a)
   *   b̂ = ◦(b)
   *   q̂₀ = ◦(â / b̂)
   *   q̂ = 2³²∙wrap32(◦(q̂₀ / 2³²)) + wrap32(q̂₀)
   *
   * We will prove that |q̂ - q| <= 1, where q = div(a, b) is the exact integer
   * quotient.
   *
   * Since 0 <= a < 2⁶⁴ and 2²¹ <= b < 2⁶⁴, and since 0, 2²¹ and 2⁶⁴ are all
   * exactly representable as doubles, the no-round-across-boundary property
   * tells us that 0 <= â <= 2⁶⁴ and 2²¹ <= b̂ <= 2⁶⁴.
   * Therefore, â / b̂ <= 2⁶⁴ / 2²¹ = 2⁴³. Since 2⁴³ is also exactly
   * representable, we have q̂₀ = ◦(â / b̂) <= 2⁴³.
   *
   * If a = 0, then q̂₀ = 0 and q̂₀ / 2³² = 0, hence ◦(q̂₀ / 2³²) is exact.
   * Otherwise, a >= 1, hence â >= 1, and q̂₀ >= 1 / 2⁶⁴, which means q̂₀ is a
   * *normal* `double` value. q̂₀ / 2³² >= 1 / 2⁹⁶ is also a normal `double`
   * value. Therefore, ◦(q̂₀ / 2³²) cannot underflow, and it is exact because it
   * divides by a power of 2.
   * Hence in all cases, we have ◦(q̂₀ / 2³²) = q̂₀ / 2³².
   *
   * We will use Theorem D3 of Hacker's Delight (section 9-1):
   * > For x real, d an integer ≠ 0: ⌊⌊x⌋ / d⌋ = ⌊x / d⌋.
   *
   * We can now develop q̂ as
   *
   *   q̂ = 2³²∙wrap32(◦(q̂₀ / 2³²))                     + wrap32(q̂₀)
   *     = 2³²∙rem(⌊◦(q̂₀ / 2³²)⌋, 2³²)                 + rem(⌊q̂₀⌋, 2³²)               def of wrap32
   *     = 2³²∙rem(⌊  q̂₀ / 2³² ⌋, 2³²)                 + rem(⌊q̂₀⌋, 2³²)               because ◦(q̂₀ / 2³²) = q̂₀ / 2³²
   *     = 2³²∙(⌊q̂₀ / 2³²⌋ - 2³²∙div(⌊q̂₀ / 2³²⌋, 2³²)) + (⌊q̂₀⌋ - 2³²∙div(⌊q̂₀⌋, 2³²))  def of rem
   *     = 2³²∙(⌊q̂₀ / 2³²⌋ - 2³²∙⌊⌊q̂₀ / 2³²⌋ / 2³²⌋  ) + (⌊q̂₀⌋ - 2³²∙⌊⌊q̂₀⌋ / 2³²⌋  )  def of div
   *     = 2³²∙(⌊q̂₀ / 2³²⌋ - 2³²∙⌊ q̂₀ / 2³²  / 2³²⌋  ) + (⌊q̂₀⌋ - 2³²∙⌊ q̂₀  / 2³²⌋  )  Theorem D3
   *     = 2³²∙(⌊q̂₀ / 2³²⌋ - 2³²∙⌊ q̂₀ / 2⁶⁴       ⌋  ) + (⌊q̂₀⌋ - 2³²∙⌊ q̂₀  / 2³²⌋  )
   *     = 2³²∙(⌊q̂₀ / 2³²⌋ - 2³²∙0                   ) + (⌊q̂₀⌋ - 2³²∙⌊ q̂₀  / 2³²⌋  )  because q̂₀ <= 2⁴³ < 2⁶⁴
   *     = 2³²∙⌊q̂₀ / 2³²⌋ + ⌊q̂₀⌋ - 2³²∙⌊q̂₀ / 2³²⌋
   *     = ⌊q̂₀⌋
   *     = ⌊◦(â / b̂)⌋
   *
   * We write δa = â - a. From elementary properties of ◦() and the range of a,
   * we have that â is an integer (and so is δa) and |δa| <= 2¹⁰. See the
   * explanation of toUnsignedStringLarge for more details.
   * We similarly relate b, b̂ and δb.
   *
   * We will need the following lemma:
   *
   *   (Lemma 1) For all reals x and y in [0, 2⁵²) such that |x - y| <= 1/2,
   *   it holds that |⌊◦(x)⌋ - ⌊y⌋| <= 1.
   *
   *   Proof.
   *   From |x - y| <= 1/2, we have x - 1/2 <= y <= x + 1/2.
   *   Rewrite x = n + f with n an integer and 0 <= f < 1.
   *   Then n + f - 1/2 <= y <= n + f + 1/2.
   *
   *   Observe that, in the range [0, 2⁵²], all multiples of 1/2 are exactly
   *   representable as doubles. n, n + 1/2 and n + 1 all belong to that range
   *   and are multiples of 1/2, so they are exactly representable.
   *
   *   If 0 <= f < 1/2, then n <= ◦(x) <= n + 1/2 (no-round-across-boundary)
   *   and ⌊◦(x)⌋ = n.
   *   n - 1/2 <= y < n + 1, so n - 1 <= ⌊y⌋ <= n.
   *   Therefore |⌊◦(x)⌋ - ⌊y⌋| <= 1, as desired.
   *
   *   Otherwise, 1/2 <= f < 1, then n + 1/2 <= ◦(x) <= n + 1 (no-round-across-boundary)
   *   and n <= ⌊◦(x)⌋ <= n + 1.
   *   n <= y < n + 3/2, so n <= ⌊y⌋ <= n + 1.
   *   Therefore |⌊◦(x)⌋ - ⌊y⌋| <= 1 as well, as desired.
   *
   * Now, we will show that
   *
   *   |(â / b̂) - (a / b)| <= 1/2      (1)
   *
   * To prove (1), we split into two subcases:
   * either 2²¹ <= b < 2⁵³, or 2⁵³ <= b < 2⁶².
   *
   * If 2²¹ <= b < 2⁵³, we know that b̂ = b. Therefore,
   *
   *   |(â / b̂) - (a / b)|
   *     = |((a + δa) / b) - (a / b)|
   *     = |δa / b|
   *     <= 2¹⁰/2²¹
   *     < 1/2
   *
   * The subcase 2⁵³ <= b < 2⁶² is harder, as both â and b̂ can be inexact.
   * We decompose
   *
   *   |(â / b̂) - (a / b)|
   *     = |((a + δa) / (b + δb)) - (a / b)|
   *     = |(b∙(a + δa) - (b + δb)∙a) / (b∙(b + δb))|
   *     <= |(b∙(a + 2¹⁰) - (b - 2¹⁰)∙a) / (b∙(b - 2¹⁰))|
   *       (taking extreme values of δa and δb to maximize the result)
   *     = |(a∙b + b∙2¹⁰ - a∙b + a∙2¹⁰) / (b² - b∙2¹⁰)|
   *     = |((a + b)∙2¹⁰) / (b² - b∙2¹⁰)|
   *     <= |((2⁶⁴ + 2⁶²)∙2¹⁰) / ((2⁵³)² - 2⁵³∙2¹⁰)|
   *       (taking extreme values of a and b to maximize the result)
   *     ~= 2.91 * 10⁻¹⁰
   *     < 1/2
   *
   * From (1), Lemma 1, and the fact that both (â / b̂) and (a / b)
   * are <= 2⁴³ < 2⁵², we conclude that
   *
   *   |q̂ - q| = |⌊◦(â / b̂)⌋ - ⌊a/b⌋| <= 1
   *
   * as desired.
   *
   * ---
   *
   * Now that we have computed q̂ and established that |q̂ - q| <= 1, we can use
   * the estimated remainder to fix the result.
   *
   * We compute
   *
   *   r̂ = a - b∙q̂
   *
   * and compare it to the exact remainder r = rem(a, b):
   *
   *   |r̂ - r|
   *     = |(a - b∙q̂) - (a - b∙q)|
   *     = |-b∙q̂ + b∙q|
   *     = |b∙q̂ - b∙q|
   *     = |b∙(q̂ - q)|
   *     = b∙|q̂ - q|
   *     <= b
   *
   * Combining with 0 <= r < b, we get -b <= r̂ < 2∙b. Since, b < 2⁶², we have
   * -2⁶² < r̂ < 2⁶³, and therefore the computation of r̂ does not overflow when
   * done with `long` operations, interpreting r̂ as a signed quantity.
   *
   * Finally, we can compare r̂ against 0 and against b to decide whether
   * q̂ - q was -1, 0, or 1, and correct accordingly.

    /* The algorithm here is inspired by Hacker's Delight formula for `abs`.
     * However, a naive application of that formula does not give good code for
     * our RuntimeLong implementation.
     *
     * Let a be the input value RTLong(lo, hi). Overall, we want to compute:
     *   val longSign = a >> 63
     *   (a ^ longSign) + (if (longSign) 1L else 0L)
     * The last addition is performed as `- longSign` in the original formula.
     * For our purpose, it is more convenient to take a step back and express
     * it as the if expression.
     *
     * First, observe that `longSign.lo` and `longSign.hi` are both equal to
     * `hi >> 31`. We therefore define
     *   val sign = hi >> 31
     * and rewrite our second expression by expanding the long xor:
     *   RTLong(lo ^ sign, hi ^ sign) + (if (sign) 1L else 0L)
     *
     * Making the lo/hi words of the result of the xor explicit, we get:
     *
     *   val xlo = lo ^ sign
     *   val xhi = hi ^ sign
     *   RTLong(xlo, xhi) + (if (sign) 1L else 0L)
     *
     * At this point, it is convenient to examine what happens when we expand
     * the addition, assuming that the 1L branch is taken. We expand
     * `RTLong(xlo, xhi) + RTLong(1, 0)` and get:
     *
     *   val rlo = xlo + 1
     *   val rhi = xhi + 0 + (((xlo & 1) | ((xlo | 1) & ~rlo)) >>> 31)
     *   val rhi = xhi + (((xlo & 1) | ((xlo | 1) & ~rlo)) >>> 31)
     *
     * Since only the most significant bit of the complicated logic expression
     * is relevant, we can rewrite the 1's as 0's so that `& 0` and `| 0` fold
     * away:
     *
     *   val rhi = xhi + (((xlo & 0) | ((xlo | 0) & ~rlo)) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + (((      0) | ((xlo    ) & ~rlo)) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + ((       0  | ( xlo      & ~rlo)) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + ((            ( xlo      & ~rlo)) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + ((xlo & ~rlo) >>> 31)
     *
     * If the 0L branch was taken, then we should instead have
     *
     *   val rlo = xlo + 0 = xlo
     *   val rhi = xhi + 0 = xhi
     *
     * Let us put back together everything we have so far:
     *
     *   val sign = hi >> 31
     *   val xlo = lo ^ sign
     *   val xhi = hi ^ sign
     *   val rlo = xlo + (if (sign) 1 else 0)
     *   val rhi = xhi + (if (sign) ((xlo & ~rlo) >>> 31) else 0)
     *
     * We can remove the branch for rlo as
     *
     *   val rlo = xlo - sign
     *
     * Now let's just imagine we always took the then branch for rhi. We would
     * overall get:
     *
     *   val sign = hi >> 31
     *   val xlo = lo ^ sign
     *   val xhi = hi ^ sign
     *   val rlo = xlo - sign
     *   val rhi = xhi + ((xlo & ~rlo) >>> 31)
     *
     * That's correct when `sign = -1`. But what happens when `sign = 0`? Let
     * us work it out:
     *
     *   val sign = 0
     *   val xlo = lo ^ sign = lo
     *   val xhi = hi ^ sign = hi
     *   val rlo = xlo - sign = xlo = lo
     *   val rhi = xhi + ((xlo & ~rlo) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + (( lo & ~lo) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + ((    0    ) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + 0
     *
     * Bingo! It works as well! So we can take the code of the "let's just
     * imagine" step. We inline the rhs of xhi at the only place where it is
     * used, and we get the final algorithm.
