/** A versioned thing, accompanied by its version.
 *
 *  Note that, as used in `LinkingUnit`, the [[version]] is relative to the
 *  identity of the versioned thing. The definition of identity varies as
 *  items progress through the linking pipeline, but it only gets stronger,
 *  i.e., if two items are id-different at phase P, then they must also be
 *  id-different at phase P+1. The converse is not true. This guarantees that
 *  versions can be reliably used to determine at phase P+1 whether the given
 *  item coming from phase P must be reprocessed.
