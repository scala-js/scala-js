   *    native JavaScript `class`'es and b) they inherit static members from
   *    their parent class.

   *    JavaScript arrow functions (`=>`). Lambdas for `js.ThisFunction`s are
   *    `function` functions.
   *  - Throwable classes are proper JavaScript error classes, recognized as
   *    such by debuggers.
   *  - In Script (`NoModule`) mode, top-level exports are defined as `let`s.
   *
   *  When `false`, the following semantics apply:
   *
   *  - All classes defined in Scala.js are `function`s instead of `class`'es.
   *    Non-native JS classes cannot extend native JS `class`'es and they do
   *    not inherit static members from their parent class.
   *  - All lambdas for `js.Function`s are `function`s.
   *  - Throwable classes have JavaScript's `Error.prototype` in their
   *    prototype chain, but they are not considered proper error classes.
   *  - In Script (`NoModule`) mode, top-level exports are defined as `var`s.
